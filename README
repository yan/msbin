msbin reads a stream of Microsoft Binary XML (such as Silverlight
messages) and writes its human-readable XML equivalent to stdout.

All types should be implemented, but not all are tested. 

To use:
	./msbin.rb file.msbin
	./msbin.rb - 

Where file.msbin can be a file saved from burp using the 'copy to file'
or a straight binary XML dump.
